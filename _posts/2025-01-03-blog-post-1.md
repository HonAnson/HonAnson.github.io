TLDR: I propose a simple decentralized discrete random number generating algorithm:

Heading for lunch with my colleagues
------
Having worked for my reserach assistant job in HKUST for almost 3 months, I now often eat lunch with my colleagues. We, however, have a decision everyday - *Should we have lunch at the business school canteen or the lowerground 7th floor (LG7) canteen?*

Today on our way to the LG7 canteen, I told my colleague, "There is actually a paper called *[Mental Poker](https://HonAnson.github.io/files/mental_poker.pdf)*, that allows people to play poker by just talking. Similarly, we can *randomly decide* the restaurant in a decentralized fashion".

"How?" my colleague asked. "I have a naive example" I replied.


My Naive Example
------
I define the system consist of N agents, and they have to choose option A or option B. Upon the need of a random binary decision, they follow the following algorithm:
1. All agents agrees on what option to be option A, and what option to be option B
2. all agents *shout out* an integer they chose *at the same time*.
3. Sum up all numbers each agnets provides
4. If the sum is odd, pick option A, if the sum is even, pick option B

I claim that the algorithm satisfy the following property:

**Equal**
- No single agent determines or have more influence to the final decision

Indeed, the sum $S$ can be represented by: 

$$
S = \sum_n u_n , \{ n \in N\}
$$

Where $u_n$ is the number decided by each agent. Since S is a function of all $u_n$, all agents involve in the final decision. The decision is also determined with $S mod 2$, so all agents have their influence across all options, regardless of other agent's information.


**Trustable**
- Each agent are *convinced* that the final decision is random
From the perspective of any agent, say agent $i$, the sum will be:

$$
S = u_i + S'
$$

Where:

$$
S' = \sum_n u_n , \{ n \in N | n \neq i\}
$$


Clearly, if $u_i$ is private to agent $i$, $S'$ will be independent from $u_i$ and agent $i$ can believe that $S$ is random. Likewise, $S'$ is private against agent $i$, so other agents can be convinced that agent $i$ has no control to $S$.

**Intrinsic**
- The algorithm clearly relies only on information provided by agents. No external information is needed (like using current temperature for random number generation)
