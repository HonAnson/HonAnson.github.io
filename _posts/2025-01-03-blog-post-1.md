TLDR: I propose a simple decentralized discrete random number generating algorithm:

UNDER CONSTRUCTION HERE


Heading for lunch with my colleagues
------
Having worked for my reserach assistant job in HKUST for almost 3 months, I now often eat lunch with my colleagues. We, however, have a decision everyday - *Should we have lunch at the business school canteen or the lowerground 7th floor (LG7) canteen?*

Today on our way to the LG7 canteen, I told my colleague, "There is in fact a paper called *[Mental Poker](https://HonAnson.github.io/files/mental_poker.pdf)*, that allows people to play poker by just talking. Similarly, we can *randomly decide* the restaurant in a decentralized fashion".

"How?" my colleague asked. "I have a naive example" I replied.


My Naive Example
------
I define the system consist of N agents, and they have to choose option A or option B. Upon the need of a random binary decision, they follow the following algorithm:
1. All agents agrees on if a given number is odd, pick option A, otherwise pick option B
2. all agents *shout out* an integer they chose *at the same time*.
3. Sum up all numbers each agnets provides
4. Use the sum to decide option base on agreement from step 1

I claim that the algorithm satisfy the following property:

**Equal**
- No single agent determines or have more influence to the final decision

Indeed, the sum $S$ can be represented by: 

$$
S = \sum_n u_n , \{ n \in N\}
$$

Where $u_n$ is the number decided by each agent. Since S is a function of all $u_n$, all agents involve in the final decision. The decision is also determined with $S mod 2$, so all agents have their influence across all options, regardless of other agent's information.


**Trustable**
- Each agent are *convinced* that the final decision is random
From the perspective of any agent, say agent $i$, the sum will be:

$$
S = u_i + S'
$$

Where $S'$ is the sum of integer provided by all other agents:

$$
S' = \sum_n u_n , \{ n \in N | n \neq i\}
$$


Clearly, if $u_i$ is private to agent $i$, $S'$ will be independent from $u_i$ and agent $i$ can believe that $S$ is random. Likewise, $S'$ is private against agent $i$, so other agents can be convinced that agent $i$ has no control to $S$. More importantly, even if all other agents colloborates, the isolated agent can still trust that the decision is random.

**Intrinsic**
- The algorithm clearly relies only on information provided by agents. No external information is needed (like using current temperature for random number generation)

Problem of shouting out number together
----------------
"Alright", said my colleage (like they care at all), "But how are we supposed to hear each other if we are shouting the numbers all at once?". Indeed, more importantly, if one of the agent *delays* shouting, its unfair to other agents. 

I propose the following modificaiton to the algorithm mentioned above to handle this problem:

1. All agents agrees on if a given number is odd, pick option A, otherwise pick option B
2. All agents forms a loop, then tell the next agent an integer they come up with
3. All agents reports to all other agents the number they received
4. All agents check if the number reported by the next agent matches the number they provided
5. Sum all the numbers provided
6. Make decision based on agreement from step 1
